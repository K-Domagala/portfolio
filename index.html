                <p>Hi, I'm Krystian Domagala and I am an aspiring Full-Stack engineer. I am currently taking the Full-stack engineering course at codecademy as part of my IT career change traineeship program.</p>
                <p>So far, I was able to quickly advance through the first stages of the traineeship program by using all the skills I have aquired from studying my maths degree.</p>
                <p>(This website is still a work in progress. Some of my projects haven't made their way onto here yet)</p>

                <article>This is one of the projects i have done at university. I had to invent an algorithm to lower the amount of partitions within a database. This was a very primative program that was inefficient, but it was the very first useful program I have ever written with very little knowledge of Java.</article>

                <article>
                    In this project, I have created a fully functioning e-commerce website where you can create an account and log in, browse the shop using the search bar, add products to your cart and check out.
                    I have implemented the front-end using React, the back-end using node.js, server was handled using express and the data was stored in a SQL database.
                    Currently looking to implement OAuth login option.
